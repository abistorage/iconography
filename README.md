###  Multiple constants - Treeshakable and typesafe with one file (`conversionType==='constants'`)

Converts your svg icons into multiple constants in the same file so that they can be used in combination with an icon registry. It furthermore also generates all necssary types.

![Output scenario one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kreuzerk/svg-to-ts/master/assets/example-src1.png)
Only the icons included in the consuming SPA also end up in the final bundle of the SPA.

#### Example usage

Let's say we have the following four svg files in a `inputfiles` folder.

- expressionless.svg
- full.svg
- laughing.svg
- smiling-face.svg

We can now run
`svg-to-ts.ts --conversionType constants -s ./inputfiles -o ./dist`
and we end up with the following file in our `dist` folder.

#### Sample ouput

```javascript
export const myIconExpressionLess: MyIcon = {
  name: 'expression_less',
  data: `<svg xmlns="http://...`
};
export const myIconFull: MyIcon = {
  name: 'full',
  data: `<svg xmlns="http://www...`
};
export const myIconLaughing: MyIcon = {
  name: 'laughing',
  data: `<svg xmlns="http://www.w...`
};
export const myIconSmilingFace: MyIcon = {
  name: 'smiling_face',
  data: `<svg xmlns="http://www.w3...`
};
/* ⚠️ Do not edit this file - this file is generated by svg-to-ts*/

export type myIcons = 'expression_less' | 'full' | 'laughing' | 'smiling_face';
export interface MyIcon {
  name: myIcons;
  data: string;
}
```

### Tree shakable and optimized for lazy loading (`conversionType==='files'`)

This is the most sophisticated approach and also the approach that doesn't only support tree shaking but also supports code splitting which is especially usefull in scenarios where you are using lazy loading.

![fully tree shakable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kreuzerk/svg-to-ts/master/assets/fully-treeshakable.png)
Often, having the SVGs in a single file is enough. However, if you are in a more complex environment with bigger business
applications, you may want to make the icons even more tree shakable.
